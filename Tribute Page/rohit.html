        Rohit Sharma was born on April 30, 1987, in Nagpur, Maharashtra, India.
        Rohit Gurunath Sharma grew up in a modest family. His father, Gurunath Sharma, worked as a caretaker in a
        transport firm storehouse, while his mother, Purnima Sharma, is a homemaker. Due to financial constraints,
        Rohit spent his early years with his grandparents and uncles in Borivali, a suburb of Mumbai.

        Rohit's passion for cricket was evident from a young age. He started playing cricket in the streets and
        local grounds of Borivali. Recognizing his talent, his uncles enrolled him in a cricket camp in 1999. It was
        at this camp that his potential was first spotted by Dinesh Lad, a cricket coach and the father of his
        schoolmate, who later became his mentor. Dinesh Lad saw the raw talent in Rohit and insisted that he switch
        schools to Swami Vivekanand International School, where Lad was a coach, to receive better training and
        facilities. This move proved to be pivotal in Rohit’s cricketing journey.

        Rohit Sharma initially started as an off-spinner who could bat a bit, but under the guidance of Dinesh Lad,
        his batting skills flourished. He soon made a mark in the school cricket circuit, and his performances in
        the Harris and Giles Shield school cricket tournaments caught the attention of selectors. His talent was
        undeniable, and he was soon on his way to becoming one of the brightest young cricketers in India.

        Rohit made his List A debut for West Zone against Central Zone in the Deodhar Trophy in March 2005. His
        consistent performances at the domestic level earned him a place in the India A squad and eventually led to
        his international debut for India in an ODI against Ireland in June 2007.

        From these humble beginnings, Rohit Sharma's journey to becoming one of the most prolific batsmen in
        international cricket is a testament to his hard work, dedication, and unyielding passion for the game.
